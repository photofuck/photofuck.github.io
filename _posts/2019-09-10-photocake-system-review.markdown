The PhotoCake Online starter kit are typically sold for $350. They don’t have prices listed online since they’ll give discounts to customers that have a history of spending money with them. With this you get an Epson printer, a pack of edible inks and an assortment of edible paper in addition to some other garbage like a poster and flyers. 

The Epson printer they claim is “modified for edible use” but that’s a lie. It is a regular Epson printer which you can purchase from your local office store or online for about $90. It’s hard to find whichever model they’re currently shipping out because they buy up the available supply. 
If you’re interested in the quality of the printer, well, $90 is pretty cheap. Look up “Epson XP-430” on Amazon and read the reviews. They’re not pretty. 

The PhotoCake Online software is a computer app that looks like freeware you’d expect to contain a virus. Upon purchase of the system, DecoPac creates an account in their system. The app is locked behind this account, without it you cannot use the application. This is a form of “DRM” or “Digital rights management”. Since software is easily copyable and can spread like a disease, there has to be a way to manage who has access to the true value of the software and this account system is one form of DRM DecoPac utilizes. Remember DRM, we’ll come back to this.

The PhotoCake system has one large benefit to it and that is licensed images. 
DecoPac is a large enough company that they’re able to make deals with the giant pop culture companies of our world. This is where competitors fall flat. 
Printing a photo of Mickey Mouse and putting it on a cake to sell to a consumer is copyright infringement and illegal. Through the PhotoCake system and the use of “Image credits” one is able to sell Mickey Mouse cakes. 

There are requirements to getting access to licensed images. If you do not have a store front, you will not get access. Licensors don’t want their brands represented on baked goods coming out of a suburban house. 

Image credits used to cost $1.50, recently bumped up to $1.75 presumably so the CEO can buy a second yacht. 

While ordering Image Credits, credit card information has to be typed in every time which makes having my employees do this quite difficult and tedious. You cannot call in and have them order Credits using the card on file. This makes about as much sense as it sounds.

The other “credit” on an account is something called a “media credit”. On every package of edible paper from DecoPac (its missing more often than not) is a sticker with a long number on it, type this into their system and it gives you the same amount of media credits as sheets of paper in the package. (24 sheets, 24 credits). In order to print on the system you need at least 1 media credit. DecoPac’s edible paper is not cheap at all and there are much cheaper options found online except if you order online you don’t get media credits and thus can’t actually use the paper you purchased. It seems instead of competing in the open market they put in a form of physical DRM and call it a day. DecoPac supports answer for this is “it’s so you can keep track of how many sheets of paper you have!”. I’m going to guess this is something management tells them to repeat, I find it hard to believe someone could be that naive. 

Oh and if there is a misprint because of a paper jam or any other simple reason for losing a print job, DecoPac is quick to accuse you of fraud and you will have to fight to get another free print. Sometimes their reps rollover easily. I get a feeling they aren’t treated well. 

Quick lesson on how inkjet printer companies make money:
Inkjet printers are manufactured at a loss. The ink meanwhile is manufactured for extremely cheap and then marked up a ton. Ink is one of the most artificially expensive fluids in the world. 
At least this is the model for Epson, the company that manufactures their own printer. 

DecoPac doesn’t follow this model and yet act like they do. The edible ink is manufactured on the cheap and marked up a ton. Printers though are not sold at a loss or break-even. If you want to replace your printer it costs $250 and if you remember these printers cost about $100. That’s a 150% markup. 

Oh and I’m positive DecoPac makes profit on shipping costs too. They list shipping costs for printers as follows:

$20 - Ground Shipping

$50 - 2-Day Shipping

$75 - Overnight

$100 - Saturday Delivery


If you’ve ever shipped anything and know about costs, these are not realistic. Someone is taking a chunk of change in the middle. 

I’ve had enough experience with these printers and gotten enough “help” from DecoPac support that I’ve pieced together the biggest problem with the printers: color flow. You let the inks sit in your printer for a week without use and you had better do a rain dance and pray to the gods that your printer is still functional. 
You’ll come to your printer one day and print and find that your image comes out in a sickly green hue. After printing a color test you’ll see there is no red coming out of the printer. Out of the 4 colors, Red is the one that stops printing the most frequently. I don’t know how DecoPac makes their ink but it’s as if the Red is made from a maple syrup base. 

Ones first thought upon encountering this is to replace the Red cartridge. This is wrong and a waste of this expensive molasses. The problem lies within the print head, the piece the cartridges rest in and that carries the ink from the cartridge to the page. DecoPacs explanation for color problems is that “edible inks don’t contain preservatives and thus dry quicker than regular inks” but if you check out the Amazon reviews of the printer they consist of this problem too. It seems the printer is just cheap. Now I’m sure there is truth to the edible ink statement but that makes it even worse, we’re putting quick-dry-cement into a printer that already has problems with ink flow. From the moment you use the printer you’ve started the countdown that will lead to its demise. You’re lucky to make it 6 months with good use. 

Now what happens if your printer gets to the point where a color isn’t flowing? What options are available to us? 

DecoPac offers a solution called “cleaning cartridges”. It’s a pack of 4 cartridges that costs around $45. Contained within is a clear cleaning solution consisting of water, propylene glycol and ethanol instead of ink. Take the inks out of your printer, put the cleaning cartridges in for all 4 slots and then follow the “deep clean process” on the software. I first did this on call with DecoPac so I could understand the theory behind it. The cleaning fluid flushes through the print head just like the inks do and we hope they push out the color residually left in the print head. However… similar to if a girl gives you her number and you repeat it back to her incorrectly to test if she actually gave you her number… everytime I do this on call with DecoPac they give me different instructions. It may be employees not knowing “the process”, it may also be that this process is completely made up. 

I have had my employees spend hours on the phone with DecoPac going 
through this process. Every time they try and get us off the phone quickly but if you’re going to waste my time then I’m going to waste yours right back. 

I’ve asked DecoPac support if using a vinegar solution to clean the printer is a good idea and they threatened to end my warranty if I did. 
Not long after they released another cleaning solution for purchase that they’re dubbing “cleaning swabs”. They give you a pack of swabs and a bottle of a… vinegar solution. You can tell from the obvious scent that its vinegar. And just like my own test results using vinegar to clean the print head, it doesn’t work. 

Their warranty policies are an absolute joke. You get a 1 year warranty with the first printer that comes with the $350 price tag. Every $250 replacement there after comes with a 90 day warranty. Remember when I said you’re lucky to have 6 months of a working printer? It’s almost as if they know they’re giving you a doomed product. 

Now I’ve had experience with other edible printers, specifically the Canon IP7220. These have a removable print head which can be rinsed under a sink. It’s the same idea as the cleaning cartridges except it actually works and takes maybe 10 minutes versus hours sitting at the printer and printing over and over again. 

After a few months of use with the printer you’ll notice that you’re replacing one color more than the others: Yellow. You’ll replace it about twice as much as the others. DecoPacs explanation is that Yellow is a lighter color and the printer needs to use more of it to “warm the image”. This makes sense to me. 
What doesn’t make sense is that even when cleaning cartridges are being used, the Yellow is being spent more than the rest. This becomes malicious when one realizes that if you run out of any of the cleaning cartridges sooner than the rest then you need to buy an entire pack again to continue the process and DecoPac of course doesn’t sell cleaning cartridges individually. 
Also interesting to note that while doing the deep cleaning process, the Yellow ink is flushed out of the print head sooner than the other 3. I suspect this is because more cartridge fluid (whether its ink or cleaning fluid) is being spent from the cartridge. This is really nice!... for the Yellow. Why can’t we up the fluid usage for the other 3 cartridges? Seems to me this would speed up the cleaning process tremendously or possibly make it work in the first place. 
However for profits sake, if one were to keep a rule saying a single cartridge is to be used more than the others, that would push customers to replace an entire pack and never fully use the other 3 cartridges. That’s what you call “predatory business practices”.

Support for the system used to be pretty good. This was a couple years ago. You’d call in and get the sense you were talking to someone who knew what they were doing. Nowadays you call in and it’s a one in a million you’ll get someone worth the time. I apologise but I don’t want an elderly woman helping me troubleshooting hardware and software. 
They’ve also recently developed a lust for money. Not only will they provide shoddy support for their shoddy product but then they’ll try and upsell garbage on you. Something happened in the past 2 years to spur this change and I have a hunch its new ownership and management. 
DecoPac for a long time was owned by the McGlynn family and they recently sold ownership to a private equity firm. Since then the company has been nothing but chasing profit. They are eating their own tails. 

Successful companies and brands stand behind their image. MLMs and cheap companies are quick to try and reinvent themselves. They know that customers have flashbacks upon seeing a logo for a product they have had bad experiences with. So why is PhotoCake so quick to reinvent? In the past 3 years they have done 2 complete redesigns of the brand. Is it because customers get an urge to vomit when thinking of PhotoCake?  

In summary, they sell you a cheap printer at a marked up price and then sell you quick-drying ink which will break the printer beyond repair and then they have the audacity to sell you a scam solution to the problem they created. 

DecoPac and PhotoCake is essentially a monopoly. They cornered the market and because of a lack of serious competition they have no reason to improve or even make a functional product. 

Other competition consists of Inkedibles, Icingimages, Icinginks or Ink4cakes. If one of them could win a contract for licensed images, some real competition could come into the play and spur real development in the space. 

My solution for any bakery looking to get into edible image printing is to assemble your own system. Buy a Canon IP7220 printer online and then purchase edible inks from DecoPac or someone else. You could also purchase your own Epson printer from Amazon and buy edible inks from DecoPac. A $100 printer that you replace every few months is much better than $250. If the $150 difference is worth it for licensed images then you only have one option and I wish you well.
